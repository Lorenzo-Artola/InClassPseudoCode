1. Convert to all caps
String phrase = user input
If 
string is lowercase, convert string to uppercase
If 
user enters integer, send string "try again"
go back to waiting for input
print phrase


2. have user input 2 numbers, add then print
x = user input
y = user input

add x + y = z
  print z

3. unknown numbers

while (true)
if 
yes, input x
print 
else
print total
break loop

add all inputs = total

if 
string or char, 
print "error, try again"


4. max number generator
 max (int) = 100
print "welcome to the random number generator"
print "enter a number and try to guess it right"

guess (int) = user input
random = win  (random number generated 0 - 100)

if 
guess = win
print "you got it!"
else
print "try again"

if 
integer exceeds 100 or is less than 0
print "number is too high or low, try again)

if 
string or char is inputed
print "Error, cannot input words, try again"

5. random number gen, even print right, odd print left

random (int) = num

while
  if num is % 2
  print "right"
  else if num is % 3
  print "left"

  if 
  num = 0
